Project: ECOSENSE: IOT-Driven power monitoring and centralized control system for energy conservation.


ECOSense is a good project if you are monitoring small number of AC units.

But if we use ECOSense in a factory or a small community where multiple AC units, controlling the AC by turning on/off the power source is not efficient
solution. You will be needing one node per AC unit which will be quite expensive when using platform such as AWS, Things.ph, or Blynk. Also turning off
the AC by removing the power source can be detrimental to the AC units.

I suggest use a modbus capable power meter and a contactor to control the AC units this will still control the power source, same functionality as the current ECOSense
but this offers the ability to use modbus to control AC units that are compatible with modbus protocol. Turning on/off an AC unit using the MODBUS will ensure the longevity
of the AC units as the device will turn off normally.

The major advantage of this setup is that you will only use one node every 32 AC units. This will greatly reduce the cost in the IoT cloud development.
