Hello Sir Oli,

Good morning!

I have decided to not continue my resignation. Please allow me to stay with our team until we find suitable candidate that can
assume my position.

There are a lot of things going on in my life right now that its hard to keep up. I apologize I let my emotion influence my better judgement.

I care about DnD team, I am proud of what we acheive as a team. I can't promise you that I'll stay for 5 years or more but please allow me 
to exit without harming the team.

We have a decent team here right now. Let's nourish it. Please continue to hire new candidate that we can train so that we keep our team healthy.

Once more, I apologize for the ruckus I caused.

Thank you for understanding.

Regards,
Bryndell Torio
